            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>In ancient times both the Swediſh and the Goths had their owne proper letters and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,<note place="margin">Gothiſh let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters aboliſhed</note> howbeit their letters have beene by the firſt founders of Chriſtianitie in theſe parts quite aboliſhed, and Latine letters put in their places. And of this ſome render this reaſon; that among theſe people were many bookes full of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient heatheniſh ſuperſtition, which ſuperſtition of theirs they thought would hardly bee quite rooted out, vnleſſe as well their letters, as books written with thoſe letters were utterly aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:27162:20"/> which are by this meanes buried in eternall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion. And of this prerogative beyond all other people of Europe (the Grecians excepted) doth this nation bragge, that they never borrowed their letters of any other nation. And it is thought that if their letters and bookes had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this time continued, they might have conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted for antiquity with the moſt famous hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, either Greeke or Latine. And therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other nations the Goths were moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired for their opinion concerning the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the ſoule: concerning which opinion, although there bee left no ancient records; yea and if there were no teſtimonie of ſtrangers to witneſſe the ſame; yet may this by many monuments even untill this day remaining, plainly appeare, the which are written upon great grave-ſtones in this ſame ancient chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of Rumcke letters, as the author ſpeakes, for in them were commonly added towards the latter end of the inſcription, theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:27162:24"/> hath beene granted them of old, that if they be able to furniſh themſelves with a good horſe and compleat armour, being able to ſerve the king in his warres, ſo long as they, or yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their ſonnes ſerve in this kind, their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours or Farmes are freed from any manner of payments to the king; and this is the reaſon why many from their very cradle, as it were, apply themſelves to military affaires; by which means alſo the number of the kings horſemen is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully encreaſed.

It is likewiſe to be obſerved, that in all Parliaments, the countrey people,<note place="margin">They have a voice in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> this laſt and ſixt ranke I meane, have a voyce as well as any of the others. And thus it commeth to paſſe, that the meaneſt or loweſt degree is not neglected, nor no well deſerving ſubiect hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to climbe to as high a pitch of honour, as his vertues can attaine unto.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IIII.</hi> Of the Politicke and civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kingdome of Sweden.</head>
               <p>IN ancient times each Province of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome had it's ſeverall lawes and conſtitutions, whereof, as it is ſuppoſed, there were divers au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, whoſe names, by reaſon of the long tract of time, are now for the moſt part buried in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion.</p>
               <p>And the Veſtrogothian lawes are ſo ancient, that it is apparant they were made at ſuch times as the Goths departed out of this kingdome,<note place="margin">Antiquities of the Veſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gothian lawes</note> or at leaſt ſhortly after: for there is mention made of the Goths inhabiting Greece and Thracia: to wit, that none of them ſhould enioy or poſſeſſe any of their ancient poſſeſſions in their owne countrey, unleſſe they would returne and dwell
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:27162:25"/> there. And it is apparent that they dwelt there before the times of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, who, as he affirmed, were to be ſhunned and taken heede of. Beſides, even before the incarnation of our Lord and Saviour, they were ſuch a terror to the Romans, that they were by them much hindered from inlarging their dominion beyond the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubius. Now theſe lawes doe for the moſt part agree with the lawes of the Viſigoths, ſet down by <hi>Iſidorus,</hi> although they be farre ſhorter; for the which cauſe it is not unlike that theſe ſame lawes of <hi>Iſidrus</hi> were at the firſt collected out of the conſtitutions of the Veſtrogoths, and after, as the titles teſtifie enlarged by the kings of the Viſigoths of Spaine. Out of all theſe Provincial lawes and other conſtitutions of this kingdome, did the Biſhops and Senatours thereof above 270 yeares agoe compile this generall law, very agreeable to the law of nature, and not much differing from the civill law, but that by this controverted caſes are far ſpeedilier ended. But before we ſpeake any thing concerning their lawes, we will premit ſome generalities. In this kingdome therefore there are ſeverall principall colledges or ſocieties,<note place="margin">The whole government of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in certaine ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</note> which comprehend the whole government of the ſame.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe is called the Colledge of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,<note place="margin">1 Colledge or ſocietie of Iuſtice.</note> in the wihch are three degrees or rankes: the ſupreame, the middle moſt, and loweſt of all. In this ſupreame or higheſt ranke or order, are the noble Senators of the kingdome: in the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:27162:25"/> next are ſuch as they call Lagman; and in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Nomophylaces, as if we ſhould ſay; Recorders or Regiſters. In the third ranke or order are the Iudges of particular cities or townes, being men of good eſteeme, and of honeſt life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and not unskilfull in the lawes of the land. In this ſupreame court are iudged cauſes of the whole kingdome, as well criminall as ciuill; and to this ſupreame court, the ſubiect may from any inferiour Court of the kingdome appeale, whereas they determine and iudge whether the inferiour court hath iudged right or no; and from this court there is no appeale, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be to the king himſelfe, in whoſe power it is either to qualifie the puniſhment, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the offence. Vnder this ſuprame court are immediatly ſubiected and ſubordinate two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that of criminall cauſes, and that of the court or chamber.</p>
               <p>The next to this colledge is the colledge of war, wherein are handled all Martiall or Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary affaires, and is called the Court marſhall or martiall.<note place="margin">2 Colledge or ſocietie is that of warre, or court Marſhall.</note> To this court belongs the Councell of War. wherein are all military matters deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated and diſcuſſed: and over this court pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the great Marſhall of the kingdome. His office is, when the king cannot be preſent in his owne perſon, as generall to command over the whole army.</p>
               <p>This great officer hath with him ioyned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other aſſociates and collegues, amongſt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:27162:26"/> whom is chiefly he whom they call <hi>Riick-ſcirs Siigmeiſter,</hi> as much to ſay, as maſter of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dnance. Beſides, there is alſo a field marſhall, and under him many other commanders, both of the horſe and foot forces.</p>
               <p>The third colledge or court is that of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie;<note place="margin">3 Colledge, the court of the Chancery</note> in which are handled all manner of cauſes both civill and eccleſiaſticall. In this Court preſides the Lord Chancellour of the kingdome,<note place="margin">The Lord Chancellours office.</note> who hath the chiefe charge of the broad ſeale, receiveth and readeth all letters ſent to the king, and diſpatcheth anſwers. Beſides, in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell he propoundeth ſuch heads as they are to conſult about: and withall he hath the charge of ſetting downe and publiſhing all Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; all decrees and acts of Parliament. Hee is alſo Iudge of al private complaints and appeales from inferiour courts to the King: and finally, he hath the overſight of all the Secretaries, Clerkes, Religious perſons, and eccleſiaſticall ceremonies; and all controverſies and negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with forreine Princes, war, peace, and truce receiving meſſages from forreine Ambaſſadors, and diſpatching their anſwers. This great offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer hath ioyned with him for aſſociates or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues, a Vice-chancellour: and divers counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Chancerie, beſides the kings Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, with divers others.</p>
               <p>The fourth Colledge or Court is that of the Admiraltie,<note place="margin">4 Colledge, the Admirall court.</note> over which is the great Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall; whoſe office is to overſee the Navy roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:27162:26"/> and to ſee that it be in a readineſſe, with all things thereto belonging, againſt the time of need. He hath under him a Vice-admirall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Captaines and Commanders of every ſhip. To his court belong all cauſes concerning treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes againſt conſtitutions made for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Navy-royal, and many other things concerning maritime affaires.</p>
               <p>The fifth and laſt is the Exchequer,<note place="margin">5 Colledge is the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</note> or, as the French call it, the chamber of accounts, where are received all the revenues belonging to the crowne, tributes, cuſtomes, ſubſidies, &amp;c. Over this Court preſides the Lord Treaſurer of the kingdome, who hath alſo ioyned with him in commiſſion two others of the Nobility; and to this court belong alſo a number of clerks, who are choſen out of the inferiour ranke of people. He hath alſo under his cuſtodie the royall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of the kingdome, the apple, the crowne, the ſcepter, and the ſword. He payes alſo all the kings armie, and ſo doth hee all the kings ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants their wages, In a word hee takes all, and payes all, being accomptable to no body, but to the king himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Amongſt all the great officers of the kingdome, the Lord Marſhall is accounted the chiefe,<note place="margin">The Lord Marſhals of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing maſter of the kings houſhold, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator or orderer of the great counſell; who by the kings authority, hath power to aſſemble the whole States of the land, to command ſilence and attention, to give leave to ſpeake in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:27162:27"/> to welcome ofrreine Embaſſadours, and to provide things neceſſary for their entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To his office alſo it belongeth to remove out of the counſell ſuch as belong not thereunto, and to ſee the kings decrees, concerning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of defamation, and puniſhment of death du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put in execution. Hee ſupplyes alſo the place of the maſter of the ceremonies, and ſuppreſſeth all tumults and diſorders. To him belongeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the overſight of the kings houſhold and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall ſervants, and to correct the offenders. And finally, in all publike meetings he beares the great ſtaffe before the king.</p>
               <p>Next unto him in dignitie is eſteemed the great Lord Conſtable, the field Marſhall, the great Sewer, the Lord Chamberlaine, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of he Provinces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſmaller parts.</note>Moreover, this whole kingdome is not onely divided into ſeverall Provinces, Duchies, and Counties, but beſides each Province is againe ſubdivided into certaine territories or iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, commonly called Haradh, of the which, ſome containe moe, and ſome fewer pariſhes. Each Province againe hath its governor or lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant called Landz-herren,<note place="margin">Severall Iudges.</note> or State-haller; and each territorie or iuriſdiction hath a Iudge called Leenſman; and beſides, each pariſh hath a Iudge called Nembdarius, or Nembde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannus. Now all theſe are diſtinct offices, and ſubordinate one to another, and ſo may the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tife appeale from one inferiour court, to a next ſuperiour in due order and forme.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:27162:27"/>
               <p>The ſupreame governour or magiſtrate of the Province is called Legifer,<note place="margin">The ſupreame Iudge <hi>Legifer</hi>
                  </note> as it were a law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and iudge, and are eſteemed in dignity next unto the king, as being his iudges and uice-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Now as many as are the Provinces, as many are there of theſe ſupreame iudges: to eleven, under whom are againe above 300. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counties, or particular iuriſdictions; not unlike the courts of Parliament of France, and the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of preſidiall courts. But the difference is, that theſe ſupreame Iudges viſit every yeare a great part of their Province, untill all their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces be viſited, and when they have travelled the round, they returne againe where they firſt began (which the French Parliaments doe not) much after the manner of the Iudges circuits in this kingdome. And as this courſe is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the remedying of the publike diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the kingdome; ſo is it alſo ſome eaſe to the ſubiect, theſe iudges demanding the tribute and taxes by turnes, and not all at once, of ſuch territories and pariſhes as they viſit, that ſo the people be not all burdened at one and the ſame time.</p>
               <p>It is yet further to be obſerved, that by the ancient cuſtomes and conſtitutions of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, beſides all theſe aforementioned courts, there was yet one generall court commanded to be kept in foure eminent places of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome once or twice a yeere, for determining and finiſhing ſome caſes, which by the other
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:27162:28"/> Iudges had not beene, or could not ſo well be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided. And this they call <hi>Iudicium Pratoriale,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iudicium praetoriale.</note> which was a meeting of many Iudges together, where controverſies were duely and ſtrictly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, and ſentence according to equity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. This court was by <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, father to this now reigning king <hi>Guſtavus Adol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> ordeined to be kept twice a yeere, once in Vpſalia, in winter at the time of a great faire then kept; and the other about Saint <hi>Peters</hi> day in ſummer. The Iudges were without faile to appeare at the place appointed in proper perſon ſixe weekes after the publication of ſuch a mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Now whatſoever was in this pretoriall court determined betwixt party and party, was to ſtand firme and inviolable for ever without appeale to any other court whatſoever.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Ral or Court Royal.</note>And becauſe the king will be ſure, that iuſtice be duely executed in all his dominions, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beſides all theſe former courts, there is yet another great and ſolemne court ſometimes kept, called the court Royall or Ral; whereas either the king in proper perſon, or elſe a depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or ſpeciall commiſſioner heares all the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances betwixt party and party: and this is a court of reformation, wherin ſome things which in other courts have not beene ſo well ordered, are here reformed and amended. And this court I take to be much like that ſolemne court ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times kept in the kingdome of Scotland,<note place="margin">Iuſtice heire of Scotland.</note> called the Iuſtice aire, wherein very ſmall offences
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:27162:28"/> were ſeverely puniſhed. Now the king is ſixe weekes before the time of ſitting to intimate the fame to his ſubiects. And within 14 dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whoſoever hath a complaint againſt any, he muſt cauſe ſummon his adverſary to appeare at the day and place appointed by the kings letters, to that purpoſe to bee read in the firſt <hi>Plac it</hi> or Court; or where there is none kept, then at the next Pariſh Church. Now if any upon this ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſhall refuſe to appeare, the king or his vicegerent, ſhall notwithſtanding his non-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, (unleſſe very iuſt cauſe may bee ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) proceed to ſentence againſt him.</p>
               <p>Now as concerning their particular lawes, ſtatutes, and ordinances, the times and turnes of their meetings in Courrts of Iuſtice, the manner of chooſing their Iudges, their oaths, and what by them to be obſerved, as being too long and tedious for this ſhort tractate, I willingly paſſe by. But if any be deſirous to know their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſtatute lawes, he may have recourſe to their hiſtory, and ſuch as have of ſet purpoſe collected and ſet them downe in order. I proceed now to ſpeake of the might and power of this great king, and then by what meanes it is maintained.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the might and power of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> as well by Sea as by land.</head>
               <p>ANd firſt for his ſea forces,<note place="margin">Sea forces</note> it is certaine that the king of Sweden (beſides his gallies and ſmall ſhips,<note place="margin">Number of ſhips.</note> whereof in thoſe ſeas he poſſeſſeth no ſmall number) hath beene many yeeres agoe furniſhed with fifty brave war-ſhips, upon all occaſions ready for ſervice; and many of them furniſhed with 60. 70. or 80. great peeces of braſſe Ordnance; and now queſtionleſſe hee is furniſhed with a farre greater number. Neither yet is it any hard matter for him to make vp the number of 6000 ſaile within his dominions,<note place="margin">Number of Mariners and ſailers.</note> not of rowers and ordinary watermen I meane, but even of expert ſailers, pilots, maſters of ſhips, maſters mates, &amp;c. For all that tract about the ſea coaſt of Finland, being at leaſt 40, miles in length, together with the coaſt of the Redeucke ſea twice as long, beſides a number of Ilands af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford the inhabitants daily meanes of no ſmall commerce and traffiking by ſea; by which means the marriners may eaſily become both bold and expert. Beſides, their maintenance is not very
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:27162:29"/> chargeable to the king: for the moſt of their pay is in fiſh, fleſh, butter and cheeſe, ryce and barly, ſuch commodities as many of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries yeeld him for tribute. Theſe ſhips in time of peace uſe to be diſtributed into divers parts of the kingdom. The greateſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ly in Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holme haven, which Port is ſo fenced againſt all winds, that there they may ſafely ride againſt all winds without any anchors: beſides, that there they are alſo free from any hoſtile invaſion, there being no acceſſe thither for any ſhips but by 24. miles ſailing, and that by a number of dangerous rockes. The reſt of thoſe ſhips are diſperſed into divers other harbours, eſpecially thoſe of Finland, that ſo they may be alwayes in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if peradventure the Ruſſian ſhould make any ſudden ſtirre. Some of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine are beſtowed in ſuch ports and haven townes whereas they may inhibite the importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch commodities out of high Germany, as might tend to the ruine of the kingdome: and therefore the kings maieſty ſuffereth no ſhip to come from thence, unleſſe they have firſt a paſſe granted them, ſubſcribed with his maieſties owne hand; the which the Merchants of Lubeck often purchaſe at a round rate. And to conclude, this king is very powerfull by ſea.</p>
               <p>And no leſſe powerfull is he alſo by land:<note place="margin">His land for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> for he is able in a ſhort ſpace from among his owne ſubiects to raiſe a great armie of foot, who by reaſon of their frequent conflicts ſometimes
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:27162:30"/> with the Dane, ſometimes with the Ruſſian, but eſpecially with the Polonian, have purchaſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves no ſmall experience in military affaire, having infinitely improved the valour and proweſſe derived unto them by their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours.</p>
               <p>This king may in a fortnights ſpace call out twelve legions of well experienced ſouldiers, (reckoning three thouſand to a legion) and may carry them whither he liſt out of the kingdome, yea if it were even to the very Indians, neither yet is he unfurniſhed of choice, able, and skilfull horſemen as well in Sweden as in Finland, both theſe countries being well furniſhed with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding good horſes; the which how farre in bulke of body inferiour to thoſe of high Germany, and other nations,<note place="margin">The horſes not bigge in bulke.</note> ſo farre perhaps doe they againe ſurpaſſe them in bountie. And in truth they are very ſtout, and in conſideration of their low ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, exceeding ſtrong, being accuſtomed to hard labour, and eaſily undergoing any tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell or toile, and withall contented with any food.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">This king hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly his horſemen.</note>The lowneſſe of their ſtature hath beene the ſole cauſe that heretofore this king hath moſt commonly hyred his horſemen out of high Germany, when he was to wage warre againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny potent enemy. Now how great forces both of horſe, &amp; foot, this mighty Prince is able to bring into the field, may not onely by his late war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Polonian, but by this late and laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:27162:30"/> into Germany, undertaken for the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many diſtreſſed Princes and people from the tyranny of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> houſe, and reſtoring them againe to their ancient inheritances, eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be evidenced and witneſſed unto us. After a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges no doubt will ſtand amazed at the multitude of his valiant acts, with ſo great celerity, valour, and magnanimitie atchieved in ſo ſhort a time, who may well with that great conquerour <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Ceſar,</hi> ſay, <hi>veni, vidi, vici;</hi> and gratefull poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie will eternize his name ſo long as ſunne and moone ſhall endure, and bleſſe the time that ſo pious and proſperous a Prince was borne to the Chriſtian world.

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of cuſtomes and tribute belonging to the king of <hi>Sweden.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>NOw to maintaine all this great charge of warre and other expences, there muſt bee ſome meanes whereby it may bee effected.<note place="margin">Cuſtomes threefold.</note> For this purpoſe therfore there are certaine tributes and cuſtomes yeerely paid into the kings coffers: and theſe are of three ſorts.<note place="margin">Cuſtomes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from his mynes.</note> The firſt ſort of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute is that which is raiſed of his mines; out of the which not onely are digged iron, copper and lead in great abundance, but even ſilver alſo, of the which are coined the Swediſh dollors, for fineneſſe of mettall inferior to no other ſilver whatſoever. Now ſome of theſe Mynes are digged at the kings owne coſt and charges, and ſome at the coſt of private perſons.</p>
               <p>Of the firſt the king hath the whole benefit, and of the latter but the tenth part, as of other commodities.</p>
               <p>Of two copper Mines onely, at this time the king receives a very great benefit; and beſides, by reaſon of this abundance of braſſe and cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, it commeth to paſſe that hee is ſo well able to furniſh himſelfe with braſſe Ordnance; and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:27162:31"/> that not for his Caſtles and Forts onely, but for his Ships alſo;<note place="margin">Great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of braſſe Ordnance.</note> the ſum whereof is no leſſe then 8000. at the leaſt: and in the Caſtle of Stocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holme alone, there are at leaſt 400. great pieces of braſſe Ordnance and more might yet be made if there were any need. And if the country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did not oftentimes conceal ſome mines new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found out, the profit which would ariſe out of theſe mynes would amount to a farre greater ſumme.<note place="margin">Cuſtomes &amp; revenues ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the fruits of the earth.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The next way by which the kings revenues are increaſed, is from the fruits of the earth, and his cuſtomes as well by ſea as by land: for the king hath the tythes of all manner of graine, wheate, rye, barly, &amp;c. as alſo of butter &amp; cheeſe of beaſts, hides, fiſh, and the like; the certainty of which reuenues although it be not to us aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly knowne; yet no queſtion ariſeth it to no ſmall ſumme, and as is credible, to little leſſe then 9 or 10. millions ſay their writers: but this muſt be underſtood of their owne coine and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, not of Sterline money.</p>
               <p>Now concerning his cuſtomes,<note place="margin">Cuſtomes of all manner of merchandiſe.</note> the king re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth cuſtome of all wares tranſported out of the kingdome, or imported into the ſame. And that there be no want of good ſilver coyne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the kingdome, this order hath beene for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares agoe eſtabliſhed; to wit, that for every hundreth dollors worth of merchandize tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported out of the kingdome, they ſhall pay into the cuſtome-houſe tenne ſilver dollors in kind, or

               <p>And for every hundreth dollors worth of wares ſo tranſported out of the kingdome, the merchant is tyed to bring into the kingdome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the worth of 90. dollors of ſuch wares as are uſefull for the kingdome; and for theſe 90. dollors worth of wares, they are to pay into the cuſtome-houſe tenne dollors, or ten ounces of ſilver, or elſe the worth thereof in other money.

               <p>As for the revenue and cuſtome of rich skins and furs, it is ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſſe, according to the intenſeneſſe and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the cold, and the abundance of ſnow. For the greater is the ſnow, the greater number of theſe wild beaſts are taken. Out of the country of Lapland the Northermoſt of all his Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the king receives a great number of theſe skins or rich furs. And to the end he be not couz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he ſendeth thither euery yeare an officer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a clerke, who ſo narrowly inquireth into the number of theſe beaſts ſo killed, that very hardly can he be deceived.</p>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:27162:32"/> hee exchangeth them with merchants, for other wares wherewith they furniſh his Court.</p>

               <p>But the Nobles and chiefe Gentrie, and their tenants are for the moſt part freed from theſe impoſitions, unleſſe upon very urgent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant occaſions. But if there be an extreame neceſſitie, and there be not otherwiſe ſufficient ſupply, then their vaſſals and tenants are tyed to pay halfe of the taxe or ſubſidie, as well as thoſe who are immediately ſubiect to the king him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, the ſubiect is tyed to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the marriage of the kings daughters, whoſe dowrie hath been hitherto 100000. dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, neare upon 40000. pound ſterling money, beſides plate and other mooveables; unto the which nevertheleſſe the king may adde at his pleaſure as he ſeeth occaſion.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:27162:50"/> late experience hath taught us the contrary. It is built in a little Iland in the mouth of the ſwift river Nerva, and by reaſon of the breadth of the river could not be battered with ordnance. This ſtrong caſtle therefore being of ſo great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, was never unfurniſhed. But the great God of heaven, who according to his good will and pleaſure, diſpoſes of all theſe ſublunary things, and infatuates the wiſedome of the wiſe, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this inuincible fort into the hands of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Prince: a preſage, no doubt, of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, great and glorious victories. But the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is yet more admirable: for within the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were not unfurniſhed of ſufficient foode, and the enemies force (as ſaid is) they needed not much to feare;<note place="margin">The ſtrange manner of taking in the Caſtle of Notreburg.</note> but within their mouthes and throats there grew ſo many great warts, that although they had food ſufficient, yet could they not feed on the ſame, nor yet ſwallow down any ſuſtenance, for the which cauſe they were forced to ſurrender this ſtrong fort into his maieſties hands. And ſo he that made the walls of <hi>Iericho</hi> at the ſound of a rammes horne to fall downe, to make a way for his owne people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to enter this City, found out this way to take in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible fort. And whoſoever ſees not the ſame providence accompanying &amp; proſpering him in this ſo great a warre now undertaken againſt the whole power of the <hi>Austrian</hi> houſe and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike league, I thinke is more then pur-blind. There is in that ſame countrey another ſtrong

And although on the weſt ſide, as it loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth towards the river it might be batered; yet both that way, as likewiſe both the ſouth and north parts were well defended by this river; and on the eaſt there was a low valley, digged by natures owne induſtry, where the people had the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Neither yet was there any undermining by reaſon of that ſoile which was altogether rockie. This fort notwithſtanding, together with the former 2. and many more were by this ſame king taken in the yeare 1617, in ſo much that this great Prince was then put in no ſmall feare of looſing all or the greater part of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, whereof there was then no ſmall danger. Wherefore the great Knezor or Duke, <hi>Michael Feodoronitz,</hi> ſonne to the former perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Iuani Vaſilienitz Suſki,</hi> earneſtly ſuing for peace, it was at length by the mediation of king <hi>Iames</hi> of famous memory effected, and in the yeare 1618. fully finiſhed and agreed upon. And thus were thoſe aforementioned townes and forts, and divers others belonging to this <hi>Carelia Ruthenica,</hi> or countrey of Rexholme, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all the deeds and evidences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto pertaining, reſigned over and delivered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was this king then paſt 21. yeares of age, when he had brought to a happy end two ſo great and important warres. Now after this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and peaceable concluſion, having eſtabliſhed peace in al his Prouinces, he gave not himſelfe over to his luſtfull pleaſures (as is often too cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with young Princes) nor to drowne himſelfe with ſinnefull delights; but gaue himſelfe whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to beautifie and adorne this peaceable king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whereof ſhee was now fully poſſeſſed: which could no better be effected, then by non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the ancient good and wholeſome lawes and conſtitutions of the kingdome, adding ſome others as occaſion required.<note place="margin">Confirmation of the ancient lawes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning trafficke and commerce betwixt the ſea townes.</note> And therefore, as was already touched, he not onely rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced the former lawes and conſtitutions concerning trafficke and commerce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſea townes, but added alſo divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, tending to that ſame purpoſe; together with many other things, whereon for brevity I may not now inſiſt.</p>
               <p>But that he might leave a perpetuall memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to the Chriſtian world, that he was as well a favourer of <hi>Minerva</hi> as of <hi>Mars,</hi> hee hath left thereof a ſufficient proofe to all after ages.

This Vniverſitie by iniurie of time and devouring warres being much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammaged, and having loſt much of it's ancient ſplendour and beauty, was again by the late de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed <hi>Charles</hi> the 9. as it were, out of her aſhes not onely reſtored to former dignity and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, but a good encreaſe alſo added to her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer beauty.

               <p>This Prince, after he had lived a few yeares in peace, was againe intangled in a new warre with his Vncle <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> king of Polonia, in the
